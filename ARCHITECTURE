This project uses puppet to bootstrap puppet.  In order to to accommodate
this requirement stable versions of puppet will be placed into the suite
sub directory.  A wrapper script will configure the RUBYLIB and PATH
environment variables to use the desired version of puppet.  This
is modeled after the Solaris system of xpg* paths.  This also allows a
stable version of puppet to configure and test development and unstable
versions of puppet.  This concept is also similar to runtime environments
